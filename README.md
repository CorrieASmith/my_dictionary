# my_dictionary
This is my second code review. All of my back-end code is working. My specs are passing, and I believe my logic is clear. 
What I'm stuck on is getting the user input to display on my Sinatra webpage. This is something I've also been a little stuck on with pairs in class.
As of now, my app is running in Sinatra. It's just not serving its purpose as a dictionary.
